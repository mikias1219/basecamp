  "summary": "**Weekly Internship Report (2025-05-19 to 2025-05-26)**\n\n**Key Learnings:**\n\nThis week, the team made considerable progress in understanding and applying Large Language Models (LLMs). We explored various models, including LLaMA 2 and GPT-2, experimenting with fine-tuning techniques using Hugging Face datasets. A significant achievement was the successful creation of an AI recommendation system powered by Basecamp data. This included fetching data, developing smart reply functionality, and generating AI insights, all accessible through a user-friendly interface. The team also focused on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance context handling in responses. Preparations are underway for the DP-100 exam, demonstrating a commitment to continuous learning and skill development.\n\n**Challenges Encountered:**\n\nThe team faced several challenges related to computational resources and model access. A primary obstacle was the limited GPU memory available in Google Colab (15GB), which proved insufficient for effective fine-tuning, even with optimization techniques like quantization and PEFT. This necessitates a server with at least 30GB of GPU memory. Furthermore, access to certain pre-trained LLaMA models is gated by Hugging Face, requiring approval, which has introduced delays. These resource constraints are impacting the speed and scope of our model development efforts.\n",
  "insights": "Here's an analysis of the internship team's progress and recommendations for the upcoming week:\n\n**Key Planned Activities**\n\nThe team is heavily focused on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation to improve context handling within their project. There's also a strong emphasis on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA 2, with some exploration of GPT-2. Preparing data for fine-tuning, evaluating previous work, exploring different LLM models, and UI improvements are also planned. Several team members are preparing for the DP-100 exam, which is taking up some focus.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps**\n\nTo enhance productivity, prioritize securing adequate GPU resources (30GB+) for effective fine-tuning of LLMs. Actively explore cloud-based GPU options or request access to internal resources. Streamline the LLaMA 3 access request to minimize delays. Centralize data preparation efforts to create a consistent, well-structured dataset optimized for prompt-response training. Given the common goal of RAG implementation, a dedicated session to share learnings and troubleshoot challenges would be beneficial. Consider setting aside time for knowledge sharing on DP-100 exam preparation to support team members and encourage a collaborative learning environment. This focused approach should lead to significant progress.\n"
