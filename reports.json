  "summary": "**Weekly Internship Report Summary (2025-05-20 to 2025-05-27)**\n\n**Key Learnings:**\n\nThis week, the team focused on exploring and implementing various techniques related to large language models (LLMs) and AI-powered applications. Key learnings included hands-on experience with the LLaMA 2 model, including downloading, fine-tuning (attempted), and integrating it with Hugging Face datasets. The team also delved into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve context handling and explored its potential in enhancing AI recommendation systems. Furthermore, there was practical application of data fetching from Basecamp to power AI recommendations, accompanied by the development of a UI to visualize the data workflow. The importance of hyperparameter tuning for model optimization was also identified, leading to a significant reduction in validation loss through optimized learning rate selection.\n\n**Challenges Encountered:**\n\nA primary challenge this week was the limitations of available computational resources, specifically the insufficient GPU memory on Google Colab for effective LLM fine-tuning. This bottleneck hindered the proper training of models, even with optimization techniques like quantization and PEFT. The team also faced obstacles related to data cleaning, where the computational demands of Python libraries hampered the desired data processing. Additionally, access to certain pre-trained LLaMA models on Hugging Face required approval, introducing delays. These challenges highlight the need for access to more robust computational infrastructure to support advanced model training and data processing tasks.\n",
  "insights": "Here's an analysis of the internship team's progress and recommendations for the upcoming week:\n\n**Key Planned Activities:**\n\nThe team is heavily focused on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance context handling for their AI model. Simultaneously, there is significant effort dedicated to preparing for the DP-100 exam. Fine-tuning LLaMA models and experimenting with different models remain key objectives. Finalizing the current project phase is also a shared goal among multiple team members.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n\nPrioritize securing adequate GPU resources. The recurring challenge with limited Colab GPU significantly impacts progress. Investigate cloud-based GPU solutions or leverage any available internal resources with higher memory. Coordinate efforts around RAG implementation. Since multiple members are working on this, establish clear division of labor to avoid redundancy and foster knowledge sharing. Consider creating a shared document or meeting to discuss RAG strategies and address common implementation hurdles. Allocate dedicated time for exam preparation alongside project tasks to maintain a healthy balance and ensure both goals are met. The next week is a good time to document progress and consider giving a demo.\n"
