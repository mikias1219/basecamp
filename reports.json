  "summary": "## Weekly Internship Report Summary (2025-04-24 to 2025-05-24)\n\nThis report summarizes the key learnings and challenges encountered by the internship team over the past month. A concerted effort has been made to adapt to the project requirements and workflow, with interns actively participating in various tasks and responsibilities.\n\n**Key Learnings:**\n\nUnfortunately, no direct learning experiences were explicitly reported through the daily check-ins. Future check-in responses should strive to document specific skills gained, knowledge acquired about processes or technologies, or valuable insights gleaned from project work or mentorship opportunities. Active reflection on the learning process is crucial for maximizing the internship experience and for effectively documenting progress.\n\n**Challenges Encountered:**\n\nSimilar to the learning data, no specific challenges were explicitly documented in the daily check-ins. Regularly documenting obstacles encountered, whether technical difficulties, communication barriers, or workflow inefficiencies, is essential for proactive problem-solving and continuous improvement. Identifying and addressing these challenges allows the team to work more effectively and supports a more productive internship experience for all involved. Future reports should focus on actively documenting and addressing any impediments to progress.\n",
  "insights": "**Key Planned Activities:**\n\nThe team is heavily focused on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the AI model's context-aware responses. Fine-tuning LLaMA models, experimenting with different models, and improving UI/UX are also key activities. There's a strong emphasis on preparing for the DP-100 exam, including studying modules, practicing questions, and scheduling the exam. Data cleaning and structuring for prompt-response pairs are crucial for future fine-tuning efforts.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n\nPrioritize securing access to a server with adequate GPU resources (at least 30GB) to overcome limitations encountered with Google Colab. Streamline the data cleaning process by exploring optimized libraries or techniques that require less computational power. Address access limitations for gated models on Hugging Face promptly. Given the team's focus on RAG, consider dedicating a session to share best practices and potential roadblocks. Regular communication and collaboration regarding DP-100 preparation can create a supportive learning environment. This shared knowledge will lead to exam success for everyone.\n"
